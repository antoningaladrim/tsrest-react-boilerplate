# TsrestReactBoilerplate

## Overview

This project is a monorepo generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev). It implements a chatbot application using the [ts-rest](https://github.com/ts-rest/ts-rest) framework.

### Folder structure:

#### Apps

- client: the client application
- client-e2e: the e2e tests for the client application. Generated by nx but left empty.

#### Services

- server: the server implementation
- server-e2e: the e2e tests for the server application. Generated by nx but left empty.

#### Libs

- api: API contracts definition
- api-errors: API errors shared accross the libs and services
- completion-client: completion service definition and implementations
- scan-client: the scanner service definition and implementations (unused)
- storage-client: the storage service definition and implementations (unused)

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Start docker services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Run the server

```bash
pnpm dev-server
```

5. Run the client

```bash
pnpm dev-front
```

6. Open the client application in your browser

```bash
http://localhost:4200
```

## Create your app from the template

### Define your API contracts

Define your API contracts in the `libs/api/src/presentation` folder.

Add the contract your created in the `libs/api/src/presentation/api.ts` file.

This will automatically add it to the client in the frontend.

### Implement the API logic in the server

1. Create a controller for the manipulated objects in the `services/server/src/application` folder.

2. Create a repository for the controller in the `services/server/src/domain` folder. Add an implementation of this repository. If this implementation is in memory, you can implement in in the same file. Otherwise, create it in the infrastructure folder.

3. Create a router for the controller in the `services/server/src/presentation/routes` folder.

4. Add the router to your app in the `services/server/src/app.ts` file.
